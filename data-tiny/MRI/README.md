## Data

The MRI scans used in this project are sourced from a dataset originally published on Kaggle and licensed under CC0: Public Domain.

For demonstration purposes, a small subset of these scans is included in this directory. This allows you to run the Jupyter notebook and experiment with the code without needing to download the full dataset.
